Can´t wear a face mask with a hood? or a veil with a hat? Or a blindfold with a veil and a broadwrap around your head?

Now you can!

This mod changes the part that some apparel covers to better reflect what they cover, so you can combine items.

Current changes are:

* Visage, War, and Gas masks covers the face (eyes, nose, and mouth), so they can be worn with hats.
* Broadwrap covers top of the head (like a hat), shoulders and neck, so it can be worn with face items.
* Veil and Face mask covers the mouth and nose, so can be worn with hats and most  headsets (still intentionally can´t be worn with the Integrator headset).
* Airwire, Array, and Integrator headsets and the Gunlink now only covers the eyes and ears (and mouth for the Integrator headset), so these still can´t be worn with hats and masks however...
* Slicecap, Eltex skullcap, and Psychic foil helmets no longer cover the ears, so they can be worn with headsets.
